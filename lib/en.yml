      Our Freifunk (German for free radio) network enables regional communication - independent of commercial interests.

      Freifunk KBU intends to unite interests in free radio from Cologne, Bonn, and the surrounding regions. We are a branch of the global Freifunk "community":http://freifunk.net/.

      Freifunk is more that cheap network access for everyone. Social and political aspects are also important. The Freifunk community is part of a global movement creating free and open infrastructure.

      Our vision is to democratize communication channels by employing free networks. Freifunk communities around the world implement this idea by providing this infrastructure. A detailed description can be found "here":http://wiki.freifunk.net/Kategorie:English.
