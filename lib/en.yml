      Our Freifunk (German for free radio) network enables regional communication. It is independent of commercial interests.

      Freifunk KBU intends to unite interests in free radio around Cologne and Bonn. We are a branch of the global Freifunk "community":http://freifunk.net/.

      Freifunk is more that cheap network access for everyone. Social and political aspects are also important. The Freifunk community is part of a global movement creating free and open infrastructure.

      Our vision is to democratize communication channels by employing free networks. Freifunk communities around the world implement this idea by providing this infrastructure. A detailed description can be found "here":http://wiki.freifunk.net/Kategorie:English.
